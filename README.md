protoswipe
==========

Swipe, scroll and arrow up/down full page splash screens

## Usage 
Add js/protoswipe.js to your HTML page

Set up a container and some pages that are direct childs of the container. A UL works well.

Check the container selector and pages selector are correct in protoswipe.js

We use .pages and .page by default

Add the layout CSS (or LESS) from style.css(.less) to your CSS.

Swipe and be cool.
